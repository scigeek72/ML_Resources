Various papers, blogs, courses and videos that are of interest to me.

# Courses
- [CS 329S: Machine Learning Systems Design](https://stanford-cs329s.github.io/syllabus.html) 
  - Its an important course. Although I don't want to go through every material in the course in detail, I am nonetheless interested in an overview of how ML deployment works. Great Ressource it seems.
